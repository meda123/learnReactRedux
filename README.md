# ReactRedux Class Projects from Udemy course
https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/

Here are my projects from the Udemy class I have built so far.

### 1) One-page Youtube player inside ReduxSimpleStarter folder
Built a one-page app that allows a user to search any Youtube video based
on keywords typed in a search bar. User can then select a video and view it.
The app is 100% React-based.
